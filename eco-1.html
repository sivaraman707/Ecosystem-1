<br><h3><pre>How You Can Help Preserve the Natural Ecosystem:</pre></h3>

<p>If you have a lake or pond near your home, you may visit often to observe the animals and plants living 

there. In addition, while this may seem like a natural ecosystem, the body of water may very well be man-made. 

There are also a number of places you can go, such as a natural science museum in your area or aquarium that 

will teach you more about the way animals live, but these creatures are not in their original habitat.<br>

<h3>Statistics:</h3>
<ul value="*">
<li> Earth's population of wild vertebrates — all mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish — declined 58 

percent from 1970 to 2012. (That's up from 52 percent in the 2014 report, which spanned 1970 to 2010.) In 

other words, the total number of wild animals with backbones has fallen by more than half within one human 

lifetime.

<li> The data show an average annual decline of 2 percent, and "there is no sign yet that this rate will 

decrease," according to the WWF report. If it doesn't decrease soon, global wildlife populations could drop by 

67 percent as early as 2020.

<li> Researchers calculated these statistics by analyzing a total of 14,152 animal populations from 3,706 

species.

<li> The No. 1 cause of the decline is habitat loss and degradation, which is reducing nearly half of the species 

studied. "The principal causes of habitat loss appear to be unsustainable agriculture and logging," the report 

states, "and changes to freshwater systems." Other top threats include overexploitation (hunting and fishing as 

well as accidental "bycatch"), climate change, invasive species and pollution.

<li> The fastest wildlife decline is in freshwater habitats, which lost 81 percent of their vertebrate populations 

between 1970 and 2012. The total number of freshwater vertebrates drops by about 4 percent each year.
